    Hi 👋, I'm Drew, a Full Stack Developer from NYC. Before I started coding, I was a musician, touring the world and writing music for various artists and bands. Those experiences taught me the value of collaboration, attention to detail, and dedication to my craft, which have all carried over into my work as a Full Stack Developer. I'm grateful for my time as a musician and the unique perspective it brings to my work as a developer
<br />
<br />
I got my start in web development while running a music lesson studio in NYC, where I was asked to build and maintain the studio's WordPress website. This experience sparked my interest in coding, and I quickly became passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites using a variety of technologies.

<br />
<br />

Since then, I've honed my skills in a variety of front-end and back-end technologies, including JavaScript, React, Express, Python, and TypeScript. I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and am always eager to learn new things.
<br />
<br />

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the vibrant neighborhoods of the East Village and Gramercy, checking out new restaurants and cafes, or spending time with my fiance and our dog Sasha.
<br />
<br />

If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about technology or the latest food trends, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!
